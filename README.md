This project showcases the portal technology used in my final project for CMU's Computer Game Programming course. I'll add more detail here later.

All the interesting render code is in Scene::draw(), and portal logic is in PlayMode::handle_portals(). To build levels I made extensive use of the scenes/portal-data.py addon I made for blender, and the export scripts in scenes/ I modified to support additional data.
